# Flight Delay Prediction

## Introduction

Delay is one of the most important performance indicators in any transportation system. In commercial aviation, a delay is typically defined as the difference between scheduled and actual departure or arrival times. Regulatory authorities across the world monitor flight delays and set thresholds to classify a flight as delayed.

- In 2013, **36%** of flights in Europe were delayed by more than five minutes.
- In the United States, **31.1%** of flights were delayed by more than 15 minutes.

These statistics demonstrate how delays are a global issue regardless of the airline network scale.

With the massive amount of data generated by the aviation ecosystem, data science has become a crucial tool for extracting insights and building predictive models. In this project, we perform extensive analysis on historical flight data to identify key factors responsible for flight delays and develop a predictive model.

> Note: External factors such as climate, natural disasters, pandemics, or technical failures are **not** considered in this project due to their irregularity and regional variability.

## Problem Statement

Flight delays are common â€” about **19%** of U.S. domestic flights arrive more than 15 minutes late. These delays lead to passenger frustration and financial losses.

Accurate prediction of flight delays is difficult due to:
- The complexity of air traffic systems.
- Large datasets with multiple influencing features.
- The wide variety of methods used for delay prediction.

This project aims to **analyze causes of delays** and **predict delay probability** for upcoming flights using available flight data.

## Objective

The goal is to analyze historical flight data to:
- Gain insights into patterns and causes of delays.
- Build a machine learning model to **predict whether a flight will be delayed**.

### Key Questions Addressed:
- Does the **month** of the flight impact delays?
- Which **destinations** have the most delays?
- Which **day of the week** sees the most/least delays?
- Which **time of day** is least prone to delays?
- Which **airline** has the highest number of delays?
- What are the **primary causes** of delays?
